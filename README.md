API for Clash of Clans and Discord.

The API for Discord takes in responses from discord messages and calls the Clash of Clans program. The Clash of Clans program pulls the information from Clash API, interprets the data, and gives the desired result back to discord. Discord then displays the information in the messanger that it is given.
